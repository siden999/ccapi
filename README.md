# AI Post Automator Privacy Policy

This repository hosts the privacy policy for the **AI Post Automator** project. You can use the policy to comply with thirdâ€‘party platform requirements (e.g. Facebook App Review).

## How to access the policy

The policy text is available in the file [`privacy-policy.md`](./privacy-policy.md) in this repository. For a public web page, GitHub Pages can serve the content from [`docs/index.md`](./docs/index.md).

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
2. In the **Pages** section, choose the `docs` folder as the source.
3. After saving, GitHub will provide a public URL like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` where the policy will be visible.

You can share that URL with platforms that require a public privacy policy.
